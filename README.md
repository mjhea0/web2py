Intro to web2py
==============

Web2py is an open source web application framework, focusing on rapid development. By placing a strong emphasis on ease of use and productivity, it’s one of the easiest frameworks to learn and use. 
Despite its simplicity, though, web2py is full of features and is quite powerful and flexible—much like the Python language itself.

In this project, I demonstrate how to deploy a basic app (web form), from start to finish, so that you can learn the basics in order to move on to more advanced apps.
