It's clean, smooth and probably nothing new, but I had to try it out anyway. Of course, it's valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional and CSS2, and it tested ok on:

    * Internet Explorer 6 SP2
    * Internet Explorer 7
    * Firefox 2
    * Netscape 8.1
    * Netscape 9	
    * Opera 9.02

You can use this template free of obligation, for any purpose you want. 

The only thing we ask in return is that you KEEP the design link in the footer and do not offer this template for download from YOUR site. 

Other than that you can change everything else in any way you see fit. 

Also, if it doesn't conflict with any copyright, patent or registered trade mark, you can keep the title and the slogan as they are now. Thank you.
